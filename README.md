Vanilla JS Library

Currently is the barebone JS and HTML for a basic library to do the following as set out by the Odin Project.

If you haven’t already, set up your project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.

All of your book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user’s input and store the new book objects into an array. Your code should look something like this:

Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”. It might help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see the display.

Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.

Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.

Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.

Optionals for later would be say persiting the data beyond a refresh with a DB or local storage saving.
Also CSS would be nice.
